Queenie,Candice Carty-Williams,"Bridget Jones’s Diary meets Americanah in this disarmingly honest, boldly political, and truly inclusive novel that will speak to anyone who has gone looking for love and found something very different in its place.

Queenie Jenkins is a 25-year-old Jamaican British woman living in London, straddling two cultures and slotting neatly into neither. She works at a national newspaper, where she’s constantly forced to compare herself to her white middle class peers. After a messy break up from her long-term white boyfriend, Queenie seeks comfort in all the wrong places…including several hazardous men who do a good job of occupying brain space and a bad job of affirming self-worth.

As Queenie careens from one questionable decision to another, she finds herself wondering, “What are you doing? Why are you doing it? Who do you want to be?”—all of the questions today’s woman must face in a world trying to answer them for her.

With “fresh and honest” (Jojo Moyes) prose, Queenie is a remarkably relatable exploration of what it means to be a modern woman searching for meaning in today’s world.",https://tinyurl.com/yd2lfkxp,"https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1580245350-51KGeS2os3L.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.968xh;0,0.0140xh&resize=768:*",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36586697-queenie?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=NhCidbsmKm&rank=1
Between the World and Me,Ta-Nehisi Coates,"“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.”
 
In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?
 
Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.",https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812993543/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1,"https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1549482990-51ndtpPOGTL.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=768:*",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489625-between-the-world-and-me?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=rxUQeyVXhZ&rank=1
We Should All Be Feminists,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,"What does “feminism” mean today? That is the question at the heart of We Should All Be Feminists, a personal, eloquently-argued essay—adapted from her much-viewed TEDx talk of the same name—by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun. 

With humor and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native Nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike. 

Argued in the same observant, witty and clever prose that has made Adichie a bestselling novelist, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman today—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.",https://www.amazon.com/We-Should-All-Be-Feminists/dp/110191176X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2A2J97JC77LH3&dchild=1&keywords=we+should+all+be+feminists+chimamanda+ngozi+adichie&qid=1593461491&sprefix=we+should+all+be+femin%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-1,"https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1549483007-51L9u20bC7L.jpg?crop=0.952xw:1xh;center,top&resize=768:*",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22738563-we-should-all-be-feminists?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Zxo7GjYHyi&rank=1
How We Fight for Our Lives,Saeed Jones,"From award-winning poet Saeed Jones, How We Fight for Our Lives is a stunning coming-of-age memoir written at the crossroads of sex, race, and power.

“People don’t just happen,” writes Saeed Jones. “We sacrifice former versions of ourselves. We sacrifice the people who dared to raise us. The ‘I’ it seems doesn’t exist until we are able to say, ‘I am no longer yours.’ ”

Haunted and haunting, Jones’s memoir tells the story of a young, black, gay man from the South as he fights to carve out a place for himself, within his family, within his country, within his own hopes, desires, and fears. Through a series of vignettes that chart a course across the American landscape, Jones draws readers into his boyhood and adolescence—into tumultuous relationships with his mother and grandmother, into passing flings with lovers, friends and strangers. Each piece builds into a larger examination of race and queerness, power and vulnerability, love and grief: a portrait of what we all do for one another—and to one another—as we fight to become ourselves.

Blending poetry and prose, Jones has developed a style that is equal parts sensual, beautiful, and powerful—a voice that’s by turns a river, a blues, and a nightscape set ablaze. How We Fight for Our Lives is a one of a kind memoir and a book that cements Saeed Jones as an essential writer for our time.",https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Fight-Our-Lives/dp/1501132733/ref=sr_1_1?crid=AOOPMFA72B4A&dchild=1&keywords=saeed+jones%2C+how+we+fight+for+our+lives&qid=1593461730&sprefix=saeed+jones%2Caps%2C170&sr=8-1,"https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1580247216-51LfBgmusKL.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.986xh;0,0.0140xh&resize=768:*",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43682552-how-we-fight-for-our-lives?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=XClehD84ft&rank=1
"Black Leopard, Red Wolf",Marlon James,"In the first novel in Marlon James's Dark Star trilogy, myth, fantasy, and history come together to explore what happens when a mercenary is hired to find a missing child.

Well-Read Black Girl,Glory Edim,"An inspiring collection of essays by black women writers, curated by the founder of the popular book club Well-Read Black Girl, on the importance of recognizing ourselves in literature.

Remember that moment when you first encountered a character who seemed to be written just for you? That feeling of belonging can stick with readers the rest of their lives--but it doesn't come around as frequently for all of us. In this timely anthology, ""well-read black girl"" Glory Edim brings together original essays by some of our best black female writers and creative voices to shine a light on how we search for ourselves in literature, and how important it is that everyone--no matter their gender, race, religion, or abilities--can find themselves there. Whether it's learning about the complexities of femalehood from Their Eyes Were Watching God, seeing a new type of love in The Color Purple, or using mythology to craft an alternative black future, each essay reminds us why we turn to books in times of both struggle and relaxation. As she has done with her incredible book-club-turned-online-community Well-Read Black Girl, in this book, Edim has created a space where black women's writing and knowledge and life experiences are lifted up, to be shared with all readers who value the power of a story to help us understand the world, and ourselves.
